# Bank-loan-Analysis
The overall goal of this project is to analyze bank loan data to understand how various borrower characteristics influence the interest rates they are charged. The primary intent is to develop a model that predicts interest rates based on these characteristics, helping financial institutions assess loan applications more efficiently.
